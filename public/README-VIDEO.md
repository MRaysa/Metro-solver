# Video Setup Instructions

## Required Video File

Please add your video file to the public folder:

**Path:** `public/v.mp4`

The video should be:
- Format: MP4
- Recommended size: 1920x1080 or similar HD resolution
- Duration: Any (it will loop automatically)
- Content: Background animation with purple/dark theme matching the design

## If you don't have the video yet:

You can:
1. Use a placeholder background color (the site will still work)
2. Find a suitable video from stock video sites
3. Create a custom video with your design elements

The HeroSection component is configured to use `/v.mp4` as the video source.
